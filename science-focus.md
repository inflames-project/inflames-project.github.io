> *In view of changes in both climate and human activity, the question arises: how are fires changing now and in the future, and which effects will this have on climate, ecosystems and humans? Current models are unable to accurately represent spatio-temporal patterns of landscape fires globally, due to the high degree of interdependency between fires and their drivers â€“ climate, vegetation and humans. Satellite measurements play a crucial role in unravelling this complexity because they provide consistent, large-scale observations of fire activity, emissions, and their impacts across different regions, ecosystems, and disciplines. This is what will be addressed in the Interdisciplinary (Network for) Fire Research from Low Earth Orbit Atmospheric Measurements (INFLAMES) project.*
